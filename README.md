# ![](http://blog.dasroot.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/kubrick-logo.png) Kubrick Documentation Scaffolding

This charm template scaffolding is a tribute to film director, screenwriter, producer, editor, and cinematographer Stanley Kubrick. You might be asking what's the correlation? You wont find it. I just enjoy his work and wanted to attribute something to his name.

### Why?

[Juju Charms](http://jujucharms.com) are full-fledged software projects, leaving them at just a README file really seemed wrong to me. I wanted a quick way to generate documentation about a charm in lock-step verions with my code. A really quick way to do this would be to embed the documentation in the charm (or in a branch in the charm) and keep that in sync with the charm code. As revisions are tagged - tag the documentation as a complimentary tag and you're cooking with gas without breaking your workflow. Jekyll makes this super simple, and kind of fun!
